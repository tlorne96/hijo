# HiJo Smart Desk Addon/Attachment

This project is aiming to refactor HiJo into a light weight Micropython  form to allow for cheaper and longer running device allowing for a greater user experience.

Migrating this to micropython should be a relatively tough project and will require finding a replacement for the Azure Blob Storage


## Roadmap

- Update all dogshit python code to modern code that is easier to maintain

- Develop a micropython version using a I2C display for a higher quality display image and smaller form factor

- Develop a Local network that is easily scaleable and can be deployed in most environments

- Create some more modern branding that seperates it from HiJo

- Develop an API that can be called on, maybe not for a micropython version of the device though.
